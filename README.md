## An example of path optimization ##

Imagine a consumer a consumer viewing a sequence of pages on a website. The consumer can skip up to n pages at a time, and can't go back. Each page is associated with a weight representing the utility or disutility of viewing the page. We want to maximise the total weight (weights can be negative) of the pages viewed by the consumer by choosing an optimal path across the page, while respecting the constraint of the number of page which can be skipped.
