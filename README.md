## An example of path optimization ##

This code is based on an exercise for an interview in a startup. 

I was asked to optimize the path of of a consumer viewing a sequence of pages on a website. Each page is associated with a weight. We want to maximise the total weight (weights can be negative). The consumer can skip up to 5 pages at a time, and can't go back.
